Welcome to Swag's Documentation! The easiest way to get started is by mentioning Swag in chat, you'll get a response with useful information on how to view the list of commands. (Ex. swg!help)

Before you get started with Swag theirs a few things you need to know:
- Swag needs permission to perform certain actions, most of the time you'll get a message saying Swag doesn't have the correct permissions. However, if Swag can't send a message in the channel then Swag won't send anything and will stop the current action being performed.
- Slash commands require the invite URL you used to invite Swag to have `&scope=bot%20applications.commands` somewhere in the URL. [Here's the invite (with no permissions included)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=658377089954873355&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands) if you need to re-invite Swag to enable slash command.
- Swag can not perform moderation actions on members who have a high role Swag does.

*If there is something you need to know about a specific command, it will be included on the command's page.*

Now let's get into the fun stuff. Here is a list of all documented commands. If you need more help then please join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/xsapSxGaeV).
