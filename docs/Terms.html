<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>The following terms will go over the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How you may use our service and what rights we hold when you use our service.</li>
<li>What data we collect while you use our service. (User and guild.)</li>
<li>Contact information for concerns or support.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>You&#39;re permitted to use our service as much as you please unless stated otherwise by us. We have the right to prohibit you from using our service for any reason we see fit. You have the right for your data to be removed at any time. We may view your data only if required to do so by law or your data affects our service. You may not use our service for any illegal activities. Our service is free (and will stay that way), however, we have the right to restrict free access. <strong>While Swag is in your guild, deleted messages that include mentions will be sent to any user who was mentioned with the ghost ping notifier setting enabled.</strong> (We have an anti-spam filter, however.) These messages are not stored in our database. Deleted messages that do not contain mentions will not be sent to any user. We have specific guidelines on what can be included in user bios, etc. Those guidelines can be viewed in our <a href="https://github.com/Swag-Discord-Bot/Swag-Docs">doccumentation</a>. You may be notified when our terms are updated by joining our <a href="https://discord.gg/xsapSxGaev">Discord Server</a>.</p>
<h1 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h1>
<p>Below is information on what data we collect split into two categories, user &amp; guild. If you would like information removed for your guild or you, please join our <a href="https://discord.gg/xsapSxGaev">Discord Server</a> and we will remove it for you. Note that we only remove information from the account that contacted us. For guilds, the owner of that guild must contact us for the data to be removed. We do not modify data, only remove it. We can not recover data once it is removed. </p>
<p>Under no circumstances should you put any personal information in any of your user or guild settings. If you put your password in your bio, for example, we are not responsible if that password gets stolen. (As anyone can view your bio/profile.)</p>
<h2 id="user">User</h2>
<p>For users, we store user-specified settings. You must change a setting manually for it to be set or it will use the default option. <em>(Basically, unless you change a setting, nothing is stored in the database for you specifically.)</em> 
<strong>If you&#39;re muted in a guild, your user ID is stored with the length of the mute (same goes for temporary bans) until your unmuted or the length of the mute is over.</strong> If a guild chooses to log deleted messages or edited messages, then your message will be logged in that guild&#39;s specific channel, however, it won&#39;t be stored in the database. (Images and videos are not logged.)</p>
<h2 id="guild">Guild</h2>
<p>For guilds, like user settings, we store specified guild settings. These can be changed by any member of the server who has the correct permissions to do so. However, only the owner of the guild may request data to be deleted. Actions in the guild, such as bans, kicks, mutes, edited messages, deleted messages, etc may be logged in a specific channel if you enable those options in settings. We do not support logging for images or videos. </p>
<h1 id="contact">Contact</h1>
<p>If you have any concerns about these terms or just need support, please contact us by joining our <a href="https://discord.gg/xsapSxGaev">Discord Server</a>. At this time we do not have a contact email or phone number, apologies. </p>
